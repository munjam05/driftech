            <h1>Drifting is a driving style in which the driver uses throttle, brakes, clutch, gear shifting and
                steering input to keep the car in a condition of oversteer.</h1>

            <p>Drifters emphasise car control by coordinating the amount of countersteer (or opposite lock) with the
                simultaneous modulation of the throttle and brakes to shift
                the weight balance of the car back and forth through the turns. Furthermore, they strive to achieve this
                while adhering to the standard racing lines (or designated
                “clipping points” if drifting in competition) and maintaining extreme slip angles.</p>

                <h2>HOW DRIFTING WORKS?</h2>
                <p>Track taditionalists are often quick to point out that drifting is not the fastest way around a
                    racetrack – and they’d be right, but so what? What matters most with drifting, whether it’s at a
                    grassroots
                    practice day or an international competition, is having fun! There is something inherently exciting
                    about negotiating a track with the car completely sideways, quickly countersteering in the direction
                    of the slide while delicately modulating pressure on the throttle to balance the car. Not enough
                    throttle and the car will lose momentum and straighten up – too much throttle and the car will spin
                    out.

                <h2>History of DriftTans.</h2>
                <p>Drifting was first made popular in Japan and was quickly adopted by the west in the late '90s. It was
                    started by a Japanese racing driver called Kunimitsu Takahashi who started his career in
                    motorcycling
                    but turned his hand to the car racing in the All Japan Touring Car Championship.</p>
